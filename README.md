# GSCode

A Visual Studio Code language extension that provides IntelliSense support for Call of Duty: Black Ops III's scripting languages, GSC and CSC.

This repository contains the source code for the GSCode language server, which uses the [Language Server Protocol](https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/) to provide IntelliSense support for GSC and CSC. Additionally, it contains the source code for the GSCode VSCode extension, which is a language client that communicates with the language server to provide the actual IntelliSense.

For the latest information on GSCode's releases and features, please see [README.md](https://github.com/Blakintosh/gscode/blob/main/client/README.md) of the client directory.

## Reporting Issues and Tweaks

As GSCode is an indepedent implementation of a GSC language parser, it may not immediately have feature parity with the GSC compiler. This is the eventual aim, however. More specifically, we aim to ensure that GSCode catches any and all errors caught by the GSC compiler as a minimum (syntactic and semantic).

With that in mind, if you encounter any situations where the GSC compiler (Linker) reports a syntax error, but GSCode does not, this constitutes an issue. You can report these issues to the [issue tracker on GitHub](https://github.com/Blakintosh/gscode/issues); please provide the expected error and attach a script that can reproduce the issue. Issues reporting bugs in isolated script cases without attaching a script (snippet) will not be looked into!
